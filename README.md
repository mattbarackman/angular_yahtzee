# Angular Yahtzee

## Learning Goals
- Use Angular JS for the first time
- Use CoffeeScript for the second time. 
- I would like to write all the app logic in CoffeeScript, instead of Ruby, for the practice.

## Progress

### Complete:
- Installed AngularJS
- Users can add Dice, roll Dice, and select Dice to save them between rolls
- All interaction is done through Angular JS / Coffescript. There is no backend logic or use of JQuery. 

### Incomplete:
- Persistent data
- Add users, scoreboard, and game logic
